##Features
SpaceCamp is a project management site that allows users to create and administer their own projects, and to invite collaborators to contribute on those projects.

###Projects
Users create projects from their home screen.  The home screen displays all projects that the user owns or collaborates on.  Clicking on a project brings the user to the project's main page.

###Discussions
Users have the ability to make post messages on a project, which will appear in the discussions list and are viewable by all collaborators.  A maximum of five comments will appear on a project's home page, but more can be viewed by clicking on the link at the bottom of the section.  A summary of each discussion's most recent content is shown to the right of its title.

###Comments
Users can also make comments on other's discussion threads, which can be viewed by clicking on a discussion to go to its main view page.  The most recent comment can also be seen in the summary section to the right of a discussion's title.

###To-Do Lists
Each project can have multiple To-Do Lists, which appear below the discussions section and are displayed as a checklist.  To-Do Lists have a title and description, and can be created and edited by anyone collaborating on the project.  The link to edit a list appears when a user hovers over the title.

###To-Do Items
Each To-Do List can be assigned To-Do Items.  These items are displayed below the list's title, and contain a checkbox to show if they have been completed.  Each item has a title, and can optionally be assigned to a specific person who is collaborating on the site.  Each item can also be edited by clicking the link that appears to its left when hovering over the item.
